Yve Duncan Homework 11

# Did not use AskBCS for any of the homework. Although I probably should have to figure out why my plots didn't look exactly right. 

# Used documentation from pandas.pydata.org, w3schools.com, slackoverflow and github.com

# Copy1 for both Part 1 and Part 2 is my final answers for the homework
